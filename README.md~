# Cayuse Candidate Code Challenge

The following APIs were used to retrieve the specified information for a zipcode received as a command line parameter:

api.openweathermap.org => city name, current temperature
maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/timezone => timezone 
maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/elevation => elevation

## Getting Started

**This project is to be executed from the terminal.**
1. Clone the project into an appropriate folder (ex: **user/mySanbox_env/CayuseCandidateCodeChallenge/**): <br />git clone https://github.com/pdxkar/CayuseCandidateCodeChallenge.git
2. Run the command: **mvn package** 
3. Run the command: **mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.cayuse.WeatherChallenge"**
4. At the prompt, enter a zipcode and corresponding statistics will be produced.

*You might need or want to run the command **mvn clean** before running **mvn package**.

### Prerequisites
